"SO Pinyin Slugs will only work for new slugs, not on existing slugs. You can "

"<strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to manually rewrite the slugs of "
"existing permalinks, then please keep in mind that the previous permalinks "
"that have been indexed by search engines (like Google, Baidu) do not change "
"automatically. This may impact your site ranking if you just leave it like "
"that."

"A <strong>limitation of SO Pinyin Slugs</strong> is that it completely "
"ignores anything other than Chinese characters in your slug. For example: if "
"you have a product name with a number in it, then the plugin ignores this "
"number. You will have to add that manually to the slug if needed. Likewise, "
"if you're writing an English title and you combine it with some Chinese "
"characters, the resulting slug will only contain the pinyin of those "
"characters; in other words the English is completely ignored."
