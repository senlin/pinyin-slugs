WordPress plugin that transforms both Simplified and Traditional Chinese character titles into a permalink friendly slug, showing pinyin that can be read by humans and (Chinese) search engines alike.

## Description

Chinese characters don't come out good in permalinks. Without the Pinyin Slugs plugin activated, the example post I made for the screenshot will get a slug like this: *%e6%90%9c%e7%b4%a2%e5%bc%95%e6%93%8e%e4%bc%98%e5%8c%96*. With the plugin the slug automatically becomes *sousuoyinqingyouhua*.

Search engines such as [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com) cannot make much of the first slug, but they can handle pinyin perfectly, especially when it is written as one long string without hyphens or underscores.

It is possible to limit the amount of characters in the slug. The default is 100, which should be plenty for most.

The Pinyin Slugs plugin was forked from the [Pinyin Permalinks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pinyin-permalink/) plugin by user [xiaole_tao](https://profiles.wordpress.org/xiaole_tao/) as that project seemed abandoned. There have been many improvements since; read the changelog for details.

### WPML Compatible

The Pinyin Slugs plugin has received the [WPML Certification of Compatibility](https://wpml.org/plugin/so-pinyin-slugs/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Pinyin Slugs work with Simplified Chinese characters?

Yes, the plugin transforms Simplified Chinese slugs into pinyin.

### Does Pinyin Slugs work with Traditional Chinese characters?

Yes, since September 2020 the plugin also can transform Traditional Chinese slugs into pinyin.

### Does Pinyin Slugs work with the WP block editor?

Yes, it does, although one caveat is that to be able to see the change of slug, the post/page first needs to be saved. The same applies for edits.

### Known Issues

Pinyin Slugs will not transform existing slugs, you will have to change them manually.

### I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support?
